<h1> A quick guide to Lua </h1>


First of all, look at "Programming in Lua" at <a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/"> http://www.lua.org/pil/ </a>. Read up
on tables, as these are the basic type for everything in Lua.
<br><br>
But, if you want a a quick start, here you go:

<h3> Statements </h3>
Statements in Lua have no braces or semicolons, and whitespace
is not significant. Instead, statements like <tt>if ... then </tt>
use <tt>end</tt> to terminate a block. Example:
<pre>
--print something out!
if note==5 then
   print("Note was five!")
end
</pre>
 Note that comments begin with two dashes.
<br><br>


<h3> Types </h3>
Lua's basic types are numbers (Lua does not distinguish between
integers and floats), strings (which are immutable) and tables, which are
used for all data structures. Lua is dynamically-typed, and variables are not declared before use. Simply assign to them
to start using them. <br><br>NOTE: by default all Lua variables are global! To use a local variable, you must declare it using <tt>local</tt>:
<pre>
x = 5

function dostuff()
    x = x + 1 -- changes global x
    local y
    y = 5     -- y is only visible in this scope
end

</pre>
Any parameters  are automatically local, as are variables used in for loops (see later).


<br><br>
Numbers are pretty standard. +,-,*,/,%,^ can all be used to manipulate them (^ is exponentation,
not XOR). 

<br><br> Comparisons are like most other languages.
<br><br>
Strings are also fairly standard. They can concatenated with <tt>..</tt>. Slices can be made with <tt>string.sub(string, start, end)</tt>. There is some support for pattern matching/replacement, but not full regexp support.
<br><br>


<h3> Functions </h3>

Lua functions are defined with the <tt>function</tt> keyword and are terminated with end. Example:
<pre>
function dosomething(x,y,z)
    print("X is "..x.." and y is "..y.." and z is "..z)
end
</pre>

Functions are first class in Lua, so you can store them in tables
(you can even index tables with functions!). 

<pre>
function do_something_one(one, two)
   vprint(one)
end

function do_something_two(one, two)
   vprint(two)
end

ftable = {one = do_something_one, two = do_something_two}

ftable.one("hello", "there")
ftable.two("hello", "there")
</pre>

<br>
Note for functional programmers: Lua supports closures and anonymous functions:
<pre>
function returnfunc(y)
    local x = 10
    return function() print(x) x = x + y end
end

z = returnfunc(1)
z() -- prints 10
z() -- prints 11
z() -- prints 12

z = returnfunc(3)
z() -- prints 10
z() -- prints 13
z() -- prints 16
</pre>



<h3> Tables </h3>
Tables are actually hashtables and can
be indexed with any Lua type, not just integers. They are extremely powerful and 
form Lua's basic data type. Tables can be constructed literally:
<pre>
notes = {C=0, D=2, E=4, F=5}
</pre>
If the index is a string you can use . notation as in <tt>notes.C</tt>
or you can use square brackets: <tt>notes["C"]</tt>
<br>
If you don't specify keys:
<pre>
notes = {0,2,4,5}
</pre>
tables will be indexed like an array (but starting at 1 (<b>one</b>) not zero -- Lua
is always 1-indexed). So you can do
<pre>
vprint("notes[1]="..notes[1])
</pre>
Lua automatically converts strings to numbers and vice-versa, so it is safe to concatenate a number and a string together.
<br>
You could also specifically give numerical indices:
<pre>
notes = {[1]=0, [7]=2, [13]=4,[19]=5}
</pre>
But note that you must put [] around the keys in this case. Tables are <b> always </b> accesed
by reference, not value (the same is true for strings, but since they are immutable, this is of little consequence). If you want a copy, you need to write a copy function!
<br><br>
Tables can be nested. This makes it easy to represent things like lists:
<pre>

function addToList(element, list)
    --list must be a list or nil
    if not list then
        return {head=element, tail=nil}
    else
        addToList(list.tail, element)    
    end
end

function printList(list)
    if not list then 
        return 
    else
        print(list.head.." ")
        printList(list.tail)
    end       
end


l = addToList(1) --nb: omitted parameters just become nil
addToList(2,l)
addToList(3,l)

printList(l) -- result: 1 2 3

</pre>


<H3> Iteration </H3>
Simple for loops are easy:
<pre>
for i=1,10 do
 ... stuff ..
end
</pre>

You can give a third parameter if you want to specify a step:
<pre>
for i=1,10,2 do
    ...stuff...
end
</pre>

while loops are easy too:
<pre>
x = 0
while x&lt;5 do
    x = x + 1
end
</pre>

Note that you need to have the <tt>do</tt> at the end of the while statement! There's also repeat...until:

<pre>
x = 0
repeat
   x = x + 1
until x==5
</pre>
To iterate over a table, use pairs:
<pre>
for key,value in pairs(notes) do
    vprint(key.." = "..value)
end
</pre>
If you want to iterate over numerical keys in order, use ipairs:
<pre>
for i, value in ipairs(notes) do
    vprint(i.." = "..value)
end
</pre>
This will ignore any non-numeric keys but will iterate
through the numerical ones in ascending order.
