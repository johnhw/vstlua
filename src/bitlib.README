bitlib is a C library for Lua 5.x that provides bitwise operations. It
is copyright Reuben Thomas 2000-2006, and is released under the MIT
license, like Lua (see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html; it's
basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions to the email address above, or
use the LuaForge trackers.

Thanks to John Passaniti for his bitwise operations library, some of
whose ideas I used, and to Thatcher Ulrich for portability fixes.


Installation
------------

The provided Makefile builds a shared library called bit.so, which can
be installed on LUA_CPATH and used with require.


Use
---

Lua functions provided:

bit.bnot(a)       returns the one's complement of a
bit.band(w1,...)  returns the bitwise and of the w's
bit.bor(w1,...)   returns the bitwise or of the w's
bit.bxor(w1,...)  returns the bitwise exclusive or of the w's
bit.lshift(a,b)   returns a shifted left b places
bit.rshift(a,b)   returns a shifted logically right b places
bit.arshift(a,b)  returns a shifted arithmetically right b places
bit.mod(a,b)      returns the integer remainder of a divided by b

All function arguments should be integers. The number of bits
available for logical operations depends on the data type used to
represent Lua numbers; this is typically 8-byte IEEE floats, which
give 53 bits (the size of the mantissa).

The logical operations start with "b" for "bit" to avoid clashing with
reserved words; although "xor" isn't a reserved word, it seemed better
to use "bxor" for consistency.
