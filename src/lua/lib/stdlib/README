This is a collection of Lua libraries for Lua 5.1. The libraries are
copyright by their authors 2000-2007 (see the AUTHORS file for
details), and released under the MIT license (the same license as Lua
itself). There is no warranty.


Prerequisites
-------------

 * Version 2.0 or later of lrexlib, available from
   http://luaforge.net/projects/lrexlib/


Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the modules directory into a location on your
LUA_PATH.


Use
---

As well as requiring individual libraries, you can load the entire set
with

  require "std"


Documentation
-------------

The libraries are documented in a LuaDoc-like style, and HTML
documentation is produced by the included utils/ldoc script. Run

  ldoc *.lua

To get a documentation file "foo.html" for each file "foo.lua".
Pre-built HTML files are included.


Bug reports and code contributions
----------------------------------

Please make bug reports on LuaForge (see URL at top of file).

There is also a mailing list for discussing the libraries,
stdlib-users@lists.luaforge.net. You can subscribe on the project
page.

These libraries are maintained and extended by their users. If you'd
like to contribute, please write to the mailing list, or post code on
the patch tracker.
