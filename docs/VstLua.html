FAQ:
<p />
<ul>
	<li>What does VstLua do?</li>
<ul>
	<li>It allows simple scripting of MIDI events in a VST. It does <i>not</i> have any audio manipulation facilities. It is purely for MIDI control.</li>
<p />
</ul>
	<li>And why is that useful?</li>
<ul>
	<li>It replaces many custom VST MIDI manipulators with a quick and easy way of scripting MIDI events. It provides support</li>
for limited GUI creation, so that scripts can set up their own control panels. New scripts can be quickly rapid
prototyped without restarting the host.
<p />
</ul>
	<li>For example?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Say, for example, I want add a new note, a fifth above the original, if the note is below middle C. All that is needed is a script like:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	function midiEventCb(midiEvent)
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
	if midiEvent.type==midi.noteOn or midiEvent.type==midi.noteOff then                
<blockquote>
	local note = midiEvent.byte2                            
	-- decide whether to transpose it up or down
	if note&gt;=noteToNumber('C-5') then
<blockquote>
	note = midiEvent.byte2 + interval.fifth
</blockquote>
	else
	   note = note - interval.fifth
	end                
	midiEvent.byte2=note            
</blockquote>
	end                
	sendMidi(midiEvent)                    
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
	end
</blockquote>

	<li>Why aren't there many scripts?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Because you haven't written them yet! If you write a useful script, <i>please</i> send it to me so</li>
I can include it the next release.
<p />
</ul>
	<li>Why Lua? Why not Python/Ruby/Java/Lisp...?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Lua is comparitively very efficient.</li>
	<li>Lua is very lightweight. Nobody wants to deal with setting up Java just to get a plugin to work. Lua just compiles in nicely.</li>
	<li>Lua has a very simple syntax. </li>
<p />
</ul>
	<li>It would be really nice if GUI control XXX was added!</li>
<ul>
	<li>If you have a good idea of how a new GUI control could be used, let me know. However, it's a lot</li>
of work to a add new control, so it might not happen...
<p />
</ul>
	<li>Uhh, the GUI controls all reset to their original values when I close the VST window.</li>
<ul>
	<li>That's supposed to happen. If you want the values to persist, copy them to and from the</li>
VSTParameters. See scripts/drummachine.lua for an example.
<p />
</ul>
	<li>It crashes my host!</li>
<ul>
	<li>Well, it's a beta, and there are probably lots of bugs. Please send me details of (a) which host you are using and <br> (b) which script you were using and (c) what exactly happens.</li>
