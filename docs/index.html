<h4> FAQ (read me!) </h4>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><b>What does VstLua do?</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>It allows simple scripting of MIDI events in a VST. It does <i>not</i> have any audio manipulation facilities. It is purely for MIDI control.</li>
<p />
</ul>
	<li><b>And why is that useful?</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>It replaces many custom VST MIDI manipulators with a quick and easy way of scripting MIDI events. It provides support</li>
for limited GUI creation, so that scripts can set up their own control panels. New scripts can be quickly rapid
prototyped without restarting the host.
<p />
</ul>
	<li><b>For example?</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>Say, for example, I want add a new note, a fifth above the original, if the note is above middle C, and a fifth below if it is below. All that is needed is a script like:</li>

<pre>
 function midiEventCb(midiEvent)
            if midiEvent.type==midi.noteOn or midiEvent.type==midi.noteOff then                
                local note = midiEvent.byte2                            
                -- decide whether to transpose it up or down
                if note>=noteToNumber('C-5') then
                    note = midiEvent.byte2 + interval.fifth
                else
                   note = note - interval.fifth
                end                
                midiEvent.byte2=note            
            end                
            sendMidi(midiEvent)                    
    end
    </pre>
 See the <a href="VstLuaApi.html"> API </a> for details.
<p />
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> <b>I'd like to use VSTLua to process MIDI <i> before </i> my host receives it. </b>
<ul>
<li> You need to wrap up VSTLua as a standalone program. The best way to do this is to use
Hermann Seib's fantastic, free <a href="http://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm"> SaviHost </a>. Copy savihost.exe to vstlua.exe and copy in beside vstlua.dll. Now vstlua.exe will work as a standalone. Make sure you have a MIDI loopback installed (for example <a href="http://www.midiox.com/index.htm?http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm"> MIDI Yoke</a>), and you can route midi from input devices, to VSTLua, and then to your host.

</ul>
</ul>
<br><br>
<ul>   
<li><b> I can't load it in Sonar/Cubase/FL Studio/Live! </b></li>
<ul>
	<li>First, of all, you might need to edit the file lua/config.lua, and set the values to 
    <pre>
        numInputs=0
        numOutput=0
        isSynth=1
    </pre>
    before it'll show up as a midi unit.
    Secondly, it is a stupendous pain to load MIDI plugins in some programs. The <a href="http://www.mucoder.net/tonespace/tonespace_user_manual.htm#_Toc150632284"> ToneSpace manual</a> has a good guide for
    setting up MIDI plugins in all of these hosts. Just read vstlua.dll for tonespace.dll. </li></ul>
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
	<li><b>It crashes my host!</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>Well, it's a beta, and there are probably lots of bugs. Actually, I know there are lots of bugs. Please send me details of (a) which host you are using and <br> (b) which script you were using and (c) what exactly happens.</li>
<p />
</ul>
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>   
<li> <b>I'm using Sonar, but the timing seems to be wobbly. </b></li>
<ul>
	<li>
    Sonar's support for VST MIDI plugins seems to be broken. MIDI deltas are not propagated forward and are just set to zero. Complain to Cakewalk!
    </li></ul>
</ul>
<br><br>
   
<ul>
	<li><b>What license is it under?</b></li>
VstLua is released under a BSD license. The source code is available (see the link at the top).

   <li> <b> How do I build VSTLua?</b>
   <ul>
    <li> See the <a href="building.html"> building</a> instructions.
   </ul>
   <br><br>

	<li><b>Why aren't there many scripts?</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>Because you haven't written them yet! If you write a useful script, <i>please</i> send it to me so</li>
I can include it the next release. Actually, there are quite a few scripts now, but please send me more. Especially if you do some cool algorithmic music stuff!
<p />
</ul>
	<li><b>Why Lua? Why not Python/Ruby/Java/Lisp...?</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>Lua is comparitively very efficient.</li>
	<li>Lua is very lightweight. Nobody wants to deal with setting up Java just to get a plugin to work. Lua just compiles in nicely.</li>        
	<li>Lua has a very simple syntax but is very powerful. </li>
<p />
</ul>
	<li><b>It would be really nice if GUI control XXX was added!</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>If you have a good idea of how a new GUI control could be used, let me know. Soon, it
    should be possible to define new GUI controls inside Lua, so you can add and customize your own.
    
<p />
</ul>
	<li><b>Uhh, the GUI controls all reset to their original values when I close the VST window.</b></li>
<ul>
	<li>That's supposed to happen. If you want the values to persist, copy them to and from the</li>
VST parameters. The wrapper scripts defined in lua/gui.lua allow you to automatically connect
GUI controls to VST parameters.
<p />
</ul>

</ul>
